get Tor browser then visit darkfailllnkf4vf.onion if u wanna; i'm not encouraging you to i just thought i'd type something random....

Allie K Miller, head of US AI Business Development for Amazon's Amazonian Web Pokimane Services, says that girls who say they're too lacking in self confidence for STEM are perfect for boys... like a reckful predator...... Do girls who have self confidence problems really need a random teenager to hit on them for encouragement??? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrLKzNcFKoE

# common u can smoke a 1.6 trillion dollar company with 300 lines of python.... im not encouraging anyone to do it but it would be really really really funny if someone did

# this method does not require pointer hijacking on the control stack or heap (see assembly hijacking)

# for emails you can use any established server with fresh domain or new server with fresh domain and set up + maintain email protocol trust yourself

# for phone i suggest looking into dormant/abandoned physical (inc mobile) line accts and see how u can hijack those in a safe way; for most carriers you can switch the number online via a button or auto-front-end-chat with customer service; there's also virtual/burner phones

# unfairness in society (see bezos pay, logistics salary, and pokimane for some reason) encourages people to sell their old crap to whomever in a fit of rebellion and that's totally justified; plz ask jeff bezos how he has facilitated the smoking of his own company .....

# FOR CONTROL PTR HIJACKING the details depend on the operating system and how the assembly/machine language is processed, but if you can alter assembly/machine to ur choosing then it's always possible to run what you want given your intrusion contains enough memory to take over everything else

# general strategy
i think you should use an email server (rather than tempmail, which is used for testing) to store successful logins then decide what to do with them later; be sure to pickle the details of how accts were created and features; this should let you get around amazon poki poki acct security if you use neural nets to pass a turing test, by definitino

# random thought
I think it may be better to use a virtual display and then character/image recognition technology than rely on manual machine learning of some things in webdrivers; I believe there are ways to use javascript to trick automation attempts when you look up hard-coded things

Right now I'm leaving a lot of hard-coded selenium in there but I plan to eventually switch to machine-recognition of coordinates wherever it makes sense

# https://github.com/b0sh4ng-github/twitch
artificially intelligent twitch user: built using the simplest, cleanest, and most-efficient use of current technology as backbone and modular in design to human users can characterize AI behavior through easy changes, similar to how colab/tensorflow tutorials are designed

GOAL is to use reinforcement learning that measures a starting metric of user device to a success metric of deep penetration via subsets of artificially intelligent techniques deep inside of the network
