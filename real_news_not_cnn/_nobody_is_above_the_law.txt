nobody is above the law, not even incompetent judges or DAs, and any action or set of actions are judged independently

surprisingly a reckful, pokimane, and terrorists in purple seem to be, and when combined with their actions as they affect me, form most of my legal basis for asylum declarations

Why is sodapoppin, reckful, pokimane, phantomlord, and twitch staff (for example) allowed to openly get away with so many crimes, are reported to have committed the crimes, seem to post a systemic risk for society, allowed to get away (for not) while I'm not allowed to pee on a MacBook at the apple store during open hours? Can the cops answer this question while adhering to the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment?

Which country is openly a lawless sack of shit since twitch launched in 2005?

Does this trend carry over to IRL behavior? It seems quite a bit for streamers (at least nobody seems to call the cops on them, or maybe they're treated as above the law; hard to say....)
