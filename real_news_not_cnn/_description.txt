// This isn't written well cuz it was pieced together after my plan to set Twitch, Amazon, at least one District Court, and the cops up wasn't fully planned well. I'll edit it when I have time but the core logic you can extract from the hyperbole

On Twitch, there is no product safety regulation regulated by the United States where the product is based. (legally the FTC's job, but they've been absent; arguably it should be in the domain of the FCC and other organizations as well due to the danger it poses on society and individuals) Additionally there is accurate business license present for the entire thing except for certain streaming channels who bothered to follow the law and get one. Good job Blizzard retarded Entertainment. This has been true since Twitch was founded in 2005. After seeing the cops, FBI, and White House not take action (could be due to many reasons or a combination of reasons) after I repeatedly reported Twitch to them since 2019 (I joined in 2018 and only realized its legal standings a year after) I decided to perform a setup to see what everyone's actions would be and to raise awareness to the Twitch problem. 

Readers should be able to understand English, interpret the "words" "phrases" and "sentences" present in Twitch legal (or lack of) documents starting with the dictionary of "words" then interpreting the combination of words with reason or through the use combinatorics to reveal all possible meanings. If you are not illiterate or a criminal you should be able to easily verify my claims and probably find a lot of new ones yourself.

// Through this experiment I intend to either mount Constitutional challenges to various aspects of the criminal justice system which is severely unbalanced both in its interpretation of Constitutional rights at the micro level and its inability to handle the complexities of an Internet-enabled world or prove that in the United States, there is de facto persecution of individuals in favor of web gangs.

// My personal motivation for conducting such an experiment is to determine which country a rational technologist should base in.

There is no law and order on Twitch. Without going into how I was stalked, harassed, and cyber attacked by criminals, you can look up their entertainment content and find a steady stream of sexual harassment (illegal), scams(illegal), money laundering(illegal) threats(illegal), and physical crimes(illegal). They don't even have proper business licenses that describe their actual activities and are approved by any applicable governing jurisdictions. However what goes on in the private underbellies of Twitch (eg Discord) is far scarier. For example I informed Twitch repeatedly that "reckful" keeps threatening to murder everyone and not only did Twitch do nothing, they retaliated against me personally with stalking, harassment, and cyber attacks.

When I complained about this massive criminal organization to the local police and FBI earlier, no action were taken as far as I can tell.

Additionally there is no product safety regulation on the platform, which is something that should be done with the FTC, and in this case the FCC maybe.

Interestingly it's mostly American criminals and users from a lot of other countries but embarrassingly the United Kingdom and Germany, where a mass shooting occurred, account for the 2nd and 3rd most active user base. 

So far the judges at Woburn District Court have refused to consider the "Twitch factor" in MA-2053_CR_000558 which should be relevant to this case given how it was a setup by me (see evidence) to reveal a massive criminal organization that has conducted retaliatory action against me specifically when I called them out in the past.

Are these judges acting in accordance to the US Constitution as the Supremacy Clause require them to do?
