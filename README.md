# I am not advocating that you attack Amazon

# But if you wanted to attack amazon you can try to hijack a control pointer by looking at code that passes both a return address and does something else that screws up the return address to the compiler AT THE SAME TIME then you can figure out how zero days work in assembly and machine code

# Else you can take a set of leaks (Experian, any number I get in email every day) spoof it through banks etc, then shop at Amazon by sending all the warehouses to random

# To reverse a hash file (password file stored on servers) you simply get a list of primes through the i=set(initial_primes); for threat j in size(i) / count(j): find_primes(j); repeat until done to sys.maxsize or something; then reverse RSA or something easily
