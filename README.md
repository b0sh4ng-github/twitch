# I am not advocating that you attack Amazon

# But if you wanted to attack amazon you can try to hijack a control pointer by looking at code that passes both a return address and does something else that screws up the return address to the compiler AT THE SAME TIME then you can figure out how zero days work in assembly and machine code

# Else you can take a set of leaks (Experian, any number I get in email every day) spoof it through banks etc, then shop at Amazon by sending all the warehouses to random

# To reverse a hash file (password file stored on servers) you simply get a list of primes through the i=set(initial_primes); for threat j in size(i) / count(j): find_primes(j); repeat until done to sys.maxsize or something; then reverse RSA or something easily

# The find prime algorithm is to divide candidate int ( figure out the ALU internals of your processor or GPU or tensorcore to determine the exact algorithm to use ) by already found set of primes then if modulo of the divisions is never zero, you found another prime

# Using floating point does not help in the operations because the ALUs do not let you approximate better than int even if you change FP64 default to support larger numbers; check out circuit design and proof for exactly why this is true

# Hint: you have to figure out where the legs are, OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THE BOTTOM OF THE FEET (rotation), and find a parallel algorithm; you can manually tag it (with rotation as an added factor or not, you have to account for it so you might as well place it in the neural network since a detection algorithm may use rotation on top or may simply use object detection) then run it through an autoencoder or think about how to write the neural nets (artificial neurons forming layers OR filter layers) from scratch.

# Ask Google or Facebook they already did it; I'm doing it on Metal API or by using some of Apple's higher level wrappers cuz the battery life is pretty good and macbooks are relatively pee resistant
